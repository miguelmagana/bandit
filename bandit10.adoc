This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.


== Objective
The flag for *bandit10* is located in a file called *data.txt*. The file has to be catted out and piped into another command to filter out the flag in a string of filtering commands.

== Get the Flag
In this case we want to use *strings*. You can grep for the *_==_* but you don't know how many they put into the string. It is still possible to find it this way but takes more effort searching manually. 

Using *strings* puts all the characters together and the text becomes easier to read. The flag will be located after several *_=_* signs. From this point you can *grep* the *_==_* to find the only lines that contain the *=*.

Copy your password and create your password file then change your command numbers to get into the next level.
