This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.

WARNING: DO NOT SHARE THE FLAG ONCE FOUND

== Objective
To gain access to *bandit20*, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. 

NOTE: Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

== Get the Flag
For this flag you are temporarily elevating priveledges to run the setuid binary that is owned by another user, in this case *bandit20*. When you *ls* the directory you will notice the *bandit20-do* binary that is highlighted in red. Using the *ls -la* command for a detailed listing you notice the owner is *bandit20* and the "*s*" bit is set to signify *setuid*.

Execute the binary by putting *./* in front:

 ./bandit20-do

image::src/images/Bandit20-setuid.png[]

This command wil throw an error to add *id* which will run an instance where you are *bandit20*.

 ./bandit20-do id

image::src/images/Bandit20-id.png[]

After running this command you will get indication that your 'effective UID' (euid) is set to *bandit20*. You can now execute the binary with the command to cat out the flag.
 
 ./bandit-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20

This will run the command as *bandit20* and will reveal the flag. Create your password file and change your command to get into the next level.
