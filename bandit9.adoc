This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.


== Objective
The bandit9 flag is in a file called *data.txt* and is the only line of text that occurs once.

This flag can be filtered using the *uniq* command with *sort* in a chain to filter out to find the correct flag. Then this output is piped into grep but inverting the output and telling it to not give us "10". The command goes like this:

*cat data.txt | sort | grep -v "10"*

This command will filter all the lines out except for the one that is seen only once.
