This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.


== Objective
After logging into bandit0 you are working to get the flag for level 1 to get to level 2. 

Each level will give you a hint on how to solve each level. Level 1 familiarizes you with the ls, cat, cd, file, du, and find commands.

Use these commands to navigate through the file system to find the first flag. 

The hint given is a readme file so find a way to read the contents of the readme file that you located using the ls command.

Once you have the flag use it to login to the next level by changing the sshpass command to reflect the next level.
