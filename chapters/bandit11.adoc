This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.

WARNING: DO NOT SHARE THE FLAG ONCE FOUND

== Objective
The flag for bandit11 is in a *data.txt* file that contains base64 endoded data. 

== Get the Flag
For this flag we pipe the *data.txt* file into *base64* with the decode trigger, *-d*.

The command is:

 cat data.txt | base64 -d

This will decode the base64 string and give you the password in a phrase. Copy your password and creat your password file. Change your command to get into the next level.
