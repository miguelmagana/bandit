This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.

WARNING: DO NOT SHARE THE FLAG ONCE FOUND

== Objective
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. 

First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. 

There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

== Get the Flag
This game requires a little bit of recon to find the right port. The port range is large from 31000 to 32000. Bruteforcing this is possible but would take a lot of time. A better way to approach this would be to eliminate the ports that are closed. For this I used *nmap* to narrow down my port range.

Using the *-sC* trigger with *-p 31000-32000* for the port range produces a short list of ports. Completing a second *nmap* scan with the shorter list of ports and the *-sV* trigger to get their services if possible. The port that is running SSL will be labled.

You notice that port *31790* is *open* and the service is *SSL/unknown*. Now you can go through the list to find the correct port by bruteforcing the list or you can try to connect to the SSH labled port. I connected directly to the port and did not test the others.

 openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790

NOTE: You have to have the password for *bandit16* at */etc/bandit_pass/bandit16* ready to input when you login. You will not get prompted. Input the password at the blank command line prompt. 

If you did it correctly you will get a private key for the next level. Logout of *bandit16*. Create your password file for *bandit17* and save the RSA key to the file. *chmod 600* to make the file only readable by you. Once you have saved the file with the RSA key you will login with SSH.

 ssh -i bandit17 bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

The first *bandit17* is the relative path to your RSA key file. If done correctly you will login to *bandit17*. Now *cat* the */etc/bandit_pass/bandit17* password and copy it to your password file and change your SSH command to login into the next level.
