This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.

WARNING: DO NOT SHARE THE FLAG ONCE FOUND

== Objective
To get the next flag a program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

== Get the Flag
As the objective states you have to look in the */etc/cron.d/* directory. Within this directory you will see multiple cron jobs. The one that we are interested in is the one that has *22* in the label.

So...

 cd /etc/cron.d/

 ls -l /tmp/<file>

You will notice that you have read permission for the temp file.

 cat /tmp/<long number>

The flag for the next level will be displayed in the prompt. Create your password file and change your commmand to get into the next level.
