This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.


== Objective
Bandit2 texts your skills in navigating the file system and locating a file with a dash in the name. Googling the helpful search will provide the answer.

In order to view the dashed file name you need to use the relative path:

./- 

If you do not use the relative path using the 'cat -' is recognized as another command and not a file which takes you straight into stdin.
