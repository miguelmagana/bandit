This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.


== Objective
The bandit5 flag is in a the only human readable file. *cd* into the 'inhere' directory and *ls* the files to see a list of files.

You will notice that all of the files have a hyphen in the name. *./* will have to be used to be able to view the file. If you *cat* the files you will notice that they are gibberish. One will be the flag.

An easier way to find which file has the human readable text is to use the *file* command with the asterisk wildcard to list all of the files in this format:

*file ./<asterisk>*

This will list the file types which will list one that is different from the others. That is the flag. *cat* that file out for the flag.
