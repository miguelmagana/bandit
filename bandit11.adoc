This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.


== Objective
The flag for bandit11 is in a *data.txt* file that contains base64 endoded data. For this we pipe the *data.txt* file into *base64* with the decode flag, *-d*.

The command is:

*cat data.txt | base64 -d*

This will decode the base64 string and give you the password in a phrase.
