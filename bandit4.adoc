This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.


== Objective
The flag for bandit4 is inside a directory called /inhere.

*cd* into the directory. Start typing 'in' then press tab to autocomplete the directory path and press enter.

When you *ls* into the directory nothing appears because the file is hidden. Use the *ls -la* command to display all files in long list format.

After listing the hidden file you notice that it has a dot in front of the name. This makes all files or directories hidden.

*cat* the hidden file by putting the period in front. You can tab autocomplete the same by putting the period then typing part of the file name.
