This is a writeup for the Over the Wire Bandit wargame. This writeup will guide you through each level to teach CTF/Wargame basics.


== Objective
The password for bandit15 is stored in */etc/bandit_pass/bandit14*

For this level you do not get the next password but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. *localhost* refers to the machine you are working on.

The SSH key provided allows you to SSH into bandit14 using localhost to cat the flag out of bandit14.

*ssh -i <sshkey.file> bandit14@localhost*

Once logged into bandit14 *cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14* to get the next flag.
